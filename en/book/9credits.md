# 9.0 Module Credits

This is a merged version of xForms and eForms.

xForms was developed by **Dylian Melgert** (http://www.dylian.eu/) and was based on
Liaise module by **Brandycoke Productions** (http://www.brandycoke.com)

eForms was a fork of xForms developed by **Juan Garc√©s**
(http://www.educacioninformatica.com/).

Since eForms is no longer being maintained, the XOOPS Module
Development Team (**Mamba & Zyspec**) have merged the code back into xForms.
